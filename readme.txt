== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does ACF Companion Lite work? =

ACF Companion Lite is jam-packed with hunderds of lines of CSS goodness to help you transform ACF. To utilise the CSS you simply add CSS classes to ACF fields. For example, to transform the Color Picker, you add the class acfc-color-picker to the Color Picker field, and the ACF Companion Lite styles will be applied. It really is as simple as that. Take a look at <a href="https://acfcompanion.com/classes/">the available CSS classes</a> to see all the fun to be had <em>(the fields available in ACF Companion Lite are Color Picker, Link and Image)</em>.

= What are the prerequisites? =

ACF Companion works with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). So you need to have that installed and activated (obvs). ACF Companion is for those who are familiar with adding and editing fields created with the Advanced Custom Fields plugin. If you are not familiar with adding fields then please <a href="https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/">review the documentation on the ACF website</a>.

= How do I integrate ACF Companion with my legacy ACF Fields? =

Simply add the relevant CSS class/es to the relevant ACF field. CSS classes can be added at the bottom of the field settings on the Edit Field Group screen.

= How can I send feedback or get help with a bug? =

We'd love to hear your bug reports, feature suggestions and any other feedback! Please head over to <a href="https://acfcompanion.com/support/">acfcompanion.com/support/</a> to get in touch. We'll also triage issues reported here on the plugin forum, but you'll get a faster response (and reduce duplication of effort) by reaching out to us via our support page.

= Is it possible to embed ACF Companion Lite in another plugin/theme? =

Yes, it is. You'd have to include the files manually in your plugin/theme, but you're free to modify as needed (as is the case with any GPL software).
